            Modernizing and building critical business software while protecting what already works.
        </p>
        <p>
            We help small and mid-sized companies evolve aging, business-critical systems so they are
            easier to use, easier to maintain, and better aligned with how the business actually operates,
            including designing and building new software when that is the right solution.

        <h2>If this sounds familiar</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Parts of your system still work but look outdated, clunky, or bolted on</li>
            <li>Internal tools only a few people understand and no one wants to touch</li>
            <li>Software that “just works” but slows people down and frustrates new hires</li>
            <li>Integrations you cannot afford to break, especially around compliance or reporting</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

            <li>Make tools easier to use and easier to trust</li>

        <h2>How we work</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Assess what you have today before deciding how much change is actually needed</li>
            <li>Improve systems incrementally when that is the safest and most effective path</li>
            <li>Replace systems entirely when ongoing evolution no longer makes sense</li>
            <li>Balance risk, cost, timelines, and business impact before committing to direction</li>
            <li>Execute with clear ownership, steady progress, and minimal disruption</li>
        </ul>
