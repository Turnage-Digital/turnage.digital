            Modernizing and building critical business software while protecting what already works.
        </p>
        <p>
            We help small and mid-sized companies evolve aging, business-critical systems so they are
            easier to use, easier to maintain, and better aligned with how the business actually operates,
            including designing and building new software when that is the right solution.

        <h2>If this sounds familiar</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Parts of your system still work but look outdated, clunky, or bolted on</li>
            <li>Internal tools only a few people understand and no one wants to touch</li>
            <li>Software that “just works” but slows people down and frustrates new hires</li>
            <li>Integrations you cannot afford to break, especially around compliance or reporting</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What we do</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Keep your business running while your technology improves</li>
            <li>Make tools easier to use and easier to trust</li>
            <li>Get systems working together instead of against each other</li>
            <li>Avoid costly mistakes with steady, practical guidance</li>
            <li>Design and build websites and applications that support real business goals</li>
        </ul>

    <section>
        <h2>How we work</h2>
        <p>
            Not every system should be handled the same way. Some benefit from careful, incremental
            improvement. Others reach a point where replacement is the safer and more cost-effective choice.
        </p>
        <p>
            We help you make that decision deliberately by balancing risk, cost, timelines, and business
            impact, then execute with clarity and accountability.
        </p>
        <p>
            Modern tools, including AI-assisted development, allow us to move faster than ever without
            sacrificing quality, stability, or control.
        </p>
